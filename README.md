# Churn Prediction MLflow Databricks-Azure

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn, leveraging the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle. The project covers data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and model tracking using MLflow, with results stored in Databricks and Azure.

'''This project serves as a practical example of building a churn prediction system, which is widely applicable in industries where retaining customers is critical. Predicting churn helps businesses:

Identify customers at risk of leaving
Enable targeted retention efforts, reducing customer acquisition costs
Improve overall customer satisfaction by proactively addressing potential issues
The integration of MLflow, Databricks, and Azure adds robust tracking, model management, and scalability to the pipeline, which are essential for production-ready machine learning workflows.'''
